AES-128 (ECB) implementation in primitive Rust for learning purposes.

Inspired by this [random GitHub blog article](https://github.com/francisrstokes/githublog/blob/main/2022/6/15/rolling-your-own-crypto-aes.md) (it's great, go read it!) I found on HackerNews.

Do not use this code in anything of consequence!
